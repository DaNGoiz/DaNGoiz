## About Me  
I‚Äôm an indie game developer passionate about creating immersive and emotionally resonant experiences.  
My work bridges design and programming ‚Äî from gameplay systems to custom engine prototypes ‚Äî turning ideas into something you can truly play with.  

### üß© Core Skills  
Experienced with major game engines and development tools.  
I enjoy building tailored systems, such as TRPG replay frameworks.  
My graphics work covers shaders, ray tracing, procedural generation, and physically based rendering (PBR).  

### üéÆ Interests  
I‚Äôm drawn to RPGs, sandbox survival, puzzle, card, and rhythm games.  
My favorite indie titles of the year are **Celeste** and **Animal Well**.  

A long-time tabletop RPG player who once delved deep into COC and FU, and somehow got lost in the multiverse of D&D.  
I also love exploring VR and experimental projects ‚Äî for instance, [*Meditation in the Backyard*](https://github.com/DaNGoiz/meditation-in-the-backyard) on Side Quest 3.  

**Virtual Reality (VR)**: Interested in designing interactive VR experiences, such as [Meditation in the Backyard](https://github.com/DaNGoiz/meditation-in-the-backyard) on Side Quest 3.

**Robotics**: I was a member of HKU Robocon Team.
