## About Me
Iâ€™m an indie game developer with a deep passion for building immersive, engaging experiences. My work spans game design, programming, modding, and custom engine development.

### ðŸ§© Core Skills
**Game Engines**: Extensive experience with Unity, Godot, Cocos2D, Unreal Engine 5, and RPG Maker. I also enjoy building custom engines tailored to specific needs â€” such as a TRPG replay system.

**Graphics Programming**: Experienced in shader programming, spine animation, ray tracing, procedural generation, and PBR.

### ðŸŽ® Interests
**Gameplay Deisgn Preferences**: Drawn to RPGs, survival & sandbox, Sokoban  puzzles, and card-based systems.

I love all kinds of indie games. My favourite games of the year is **Celeste** and **Animal Well**.

Tabletop RPGs: Used to roll deep in COC and FU; recently wandered into the D&D multiverse and forgot the way out.

**Virtual Reality (VR)**: Interested in designing interactive VR experiences, such as [Meditation in the Backyard](https://github.com/DaNGoiz/meditation-in-the-backyard) on Side Quest 3.

**Robotics**: I was a member of HKU Robocon Team.
